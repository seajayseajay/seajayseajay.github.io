My name is Chun-Jan Young (楊淳然), but I go by CJ in almost all situations. In English, my pronouns are he/him/his. In case you're interested, my full name can be pronounced in the following ways/languages:
- In English: \[tʃʊn dʒæn jʌŋ]
- In [Taiwan Mandarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_Mandarin): \[jaŋ˨˦ tʃʷən˨˦ ɹæn˨˦] (Hanyu Pinyin: yáng chún rán)
- In [Taiwanese Hokkien/Taiwan Southern Min](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien) \[ĩ̯ũ˨˦ sun˧ ʐi̯ɛn˨˦] ([Tâi-lô](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A2i-u%C3%A2n_L%C3%B4-m%C3%A1-j%C4%AB_Phing-im_Hong-%C3%A0n): Iûnn Sûn-Jiân)

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and therefore I live and work on the traditional, stolen, and unceded lands of the Barbareño Chumash people. I work in the fields of language documentation and linguistic typology, and I hold broad interests in description and analysis across all levels of linguistic structure from articulatory phonetics to clausal syntax and discourse pragmatics. However I am pursuing my current obsession with prosody, and my dissertation project is a comprehensive study of stress and prosodic prominence in *o ciriciring no tao do pongso* (also known as [Yami or Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yami_language)), a [Batanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batanic_languages) ([Austronesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_languages)) language spoken by the [indigenous Tao people (達悟族)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_people) of [Orchid Island (蘭嶼)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchid_Island), Taiwan. I received my MA in Linguistics in 2019 from National Taiwan University.

Prior to entering linguistics and academia, I was a flutist and pursued classical music professionally. I hold a Bachelor of Music and an Artist Diploma from the University of Miami Frost School of Music, and a Master of Music from the Peabody Conservatory of the Johns Hopkins University. As such, I am also interested in the intersection of language and music.

I was born in Taipei, Taiwan, and grew up in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Shanghai before attending university in the USA. I have a twin brother who is currently Lecturer in Physical Geography at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Outside of academia, I am a massive coffee geek and a lover of cats, metro systems, and noodles.

This summer, I'll be attending and giving presentations at the following conferences:
- SEALS 33 (Southeast Asian Linguistics Society)
- 16 ICAL (International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics)
- LabPhon 19 (Laboratory Phonology)
- Speech Prosody 2024
- SWL IX (Syntax of the World's Languages)
