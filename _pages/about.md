My name is Chun-Jan Young (楊淳然), but I go by CJ in almost all situations. In English, my pronouns are he/him/his. In case you're interested, my full name can be pronounced in the following ways/languages:

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucsb.edu/) at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/), and therefore I live and work on the traditional, stolen, and unceded lands of the Barbareño [Chumash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumash_people) people. I work in the fields of language documentation and linguistic typology, and I hold broad interests in description and analysis across all levels of linguistic structure from articulatory phonetics to clausal syntax and discourse pragmatics. However, I am pursuing my current obsession with prosody, and my dissertation project is a comprehensive study of stress and prosodic prominence in *o ciriciring no tao do pongso* (also known as [Yami or Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yami_language)), a [Batanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batanic_languages) ([Austronesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_languages)) language spoken by the [indigenous Tao people (達悟族)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_people) of [Orchid Island (蘭嶼)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchid_Island), Taiwan. I received my MA in Linguistics in 2019 from National Taiwan University (臺大).

Prior to entering linguistics and academia, I was a flutist and pursued classical music professionally. I hold a Bachelor of Music (BM) and Artist Diploma (AD) from the [University of Miami](https://welcome.miami.edu/) [Frost School of Music](https://www.frost.miami.edu/), and a Master of Music (MM) from the [Peabody Conservatory](https://peabody.jhu.edu/) of the [Johns Hopkins University](https://jhu.edu/). My principal teachers were [Trudy Kane](https://www.yamaha.com/artists/trudykane.html) and [Marina Piccinini](https://www.marinapiccinini.com/). As such, I am also interested in the intersections of language and music. I served my mandatory Taiwanese national service at the famous [Timur Elementary School (地磨兒國小)](https://www.sdps.ptc.edu.tw/nss/p/index) in beautiful Pingtung County in Southern Taiwan, where I was first introduced to the Indigenous communities and cultures of Taiwan.

I was born in Taipei, Taiwan, and grew up in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Shanghai before attending university in the USA. Due to the unique circumstances of my upbringing, I speak English as my default language and Mandarin Chinese at a high (though not entirely native) level. I also speak Japanese, Spanish, German, and Dutch to constantly shifting degrees of intermediate proficiency, and have life goals to become proficient in Cantonese, Taiwanese Hokkien, Korean, and Tagalog.

I have a [twin brother](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/geography-sustainable-development/people/tjy1/) who is currently Lecturer in Physical Geography at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Outside of academia, I am a massive coffee geek and a lover of cats, metro systems, and noodles.
