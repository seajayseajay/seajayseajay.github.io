My name is Chun-Jan Young (楊淳然), but I go by CJ in most situations. I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My dissertation project is a comprehensive study of stress and prosodic prominence in *o ciriciring no tao do pongso* (also known as Yami or Tao), a Batanic (Austronesian) language spoken by the indigenous Tao people (達悟族) of Orchid Island (蘭嶼), Taiwan. I am a documentary linguist by training, and I am interested in typologically-informed description and analysis across all levels of linguistic structure from articulatory phonetics to clausal syntax, and I have worked on topics such as case marking, information structure, discourse markers, and acoustic correlates of word stress. I received my MA in Linguistics in 2019 from National Taiwan University.

Prior to entering linguistics and academia, I was a flutist and pursued classical music professionally. I hold a Bachelor of Music and an Artist Diploma from the University of Miami Frost School of Music, and a Master of Music from the Peabody Conservatory of the Johns Hopkins University. As such, I am also interested in the intersection of language and music.

I was born in Taipei, Taiwan, and grew up in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Shanghai before attending university in the USA. I have a twin brother who is currently Lecturer in Physical Geography at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Outside of academia, I am a massive coffee geek and a lover of cats, metro systems, and noodles.

This summer, I'll be attending and giving presentations at the following conferences:
- SEALS 33 (Southeast Asian Linguistics Society)
- 16 ICAL (International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics)
- LabPhon 19 (Laboratory Phonology)
- Speech Prosody 2024
- SWL IX (Syntax of the World's Languages)
