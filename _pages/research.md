## Research Interests

Language documentation; linguistic typology; prosody; word stress and prominence; articulatory phonetics and phonology; information structure; intonational phonology; case marking; (in)definiteness; clause combining; usage-based and functional approaches; cognitive semantics; historical linguistics; sociocultural linguistics; community-based and community-informed language work; language revitalization; language & music; Austronesian languages of Taiwan and the Philippines; Inuit languages; P’urhépecha

My research interests are varied and span several core areas of linguistic research, although they ultimately stem from my work on Yami. Here I will attempt to elaborate on a few overarching threads that represent my work.

## The place of Batanic in the typology of Philippine (and Austronesian) languages

Since 2018, I have been fortunate to work with speakers of Yami/Tao, the indigenous language of Orchid Island (Lanyu), Taiwan. Yami has long been regarded as occupying a unique position among the native Austronesian languages of Taiwan, as it does not belong to any of the first-order subgroups known as Formosan languages. Rather, it is most closely related to the languages of the northernmost Philippines--Itbayaten, Ivatan, and Ibatan--spoken in Batanes and Cagayan Provinces, forming the Batanic/Bashiic subgroup, and are hence considered to be part of the Philippine linkage of Austronesian (although it is still unclear just how many divisions between these languages should be made).

The Batanic languages are heavily understudied and underdocumented, and consequently do not feature prominently in discussions of Philippine languages, although they are known for many unique features that contribute to their diversity. These features include: a four-way case marking system with distinct locative and oblique cases (which I have written about), person marking, the presence of labiodental /v/ and velar fricative or approximant /ɣ/ phonemes, and supposed final (oxytone) stress (which I am currently working on). It is my goal to investigate what the distinctive features of Batanic languages are and show how this group of languages can contribute to a richer understanding of Philippine languages (and even Austronesian) as a whole.

Additionally, due to various circumstances over the years, modern linguistic scholarship on Yami has often been removed from work conducted in the Philippines, and conversely, work on Philippine languages (and even other Batanic languages) has often excluded data from Yami. I find that many questions can be answered and differing analyses can be unified by examining perspectives from across the geopolitical border, and it is another goal of mine to bring the work on the various Batanic languages into closer dialogue with each other.

## Stress and prosodic prominence in Philippine languages

Philippine (and many Formosan) languages have captured the attention of linguists for many years, with their unique verbal voice or alignment systems as their hallmark, among other morphosyntactic and segmental phonological features. Suprasegmental phenomena (such as word stress), on the other hand, have not been granted the same attention, and our collective knowledge of word-level prosody in Philippine languages comes largely from short, simple descriptions in grammars and pedagogical material. The work of R. David Zorc, Robert Blust, and Alex D. Smith have given greater theoretical importance to the topic of stress, with Zorc's work representing the first attempt at a typology of Philippine accent patterns and Blust & Smith's work demonstrating its relevance for historical reconstructions of Proto-Austronesian (PAn) and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian (PMP).

However, this work remains largely at an abstract, phonological level, which is often removed from phonetic reality. Advancements over the decades in phonetic and phonological research on word stress have revealed
