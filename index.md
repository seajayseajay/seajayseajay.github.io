I have been selected as a [2024 Austronesian Studies Fellow](https://ofas.nccu.edu.tw/news/60) at [National Chengchi University](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en) in Taipei, Taiwan! I will spend 4 months in 2025 in residence at NCCU working with Dr. Rik De Busser and conducting fieldwork on Orchid Island for my project on focus in video and conversational data in Tao/Yami!

## Hello!

Welcome to my website! I am a linguist, and my research has largely centered around the language spoken by the Indigenous Tao/Yami islanders of Orchid Island, southeastern Taiwan. I am a PhD Candidate at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I am a member of the [SPArK Phonetics Lab](https://www.ucsb-spark.com/) led by Dr. Argyro Katsika and the Language Documentation Lab led by Dr. Marianne Mithun, and I am an assistant director of the OLA (Ortografías en Lenguas Aborígenes) Lab led by Dr. Eric W. Campbell. I also regularly teach linguistics courses at the undergraduate level.

My research spans several different areas of linguistic inquiry. Here are a few topics I have worked on to greater detail:
- Acoustics and grammatical functions of word stress and prosodic prominence
- Case marking systems, specifically non-core case categories
- Clause chaining and other complex clause linkage strategies
- The expression of information structure (topic and focus)

Prior to my journey into academic & linguistic research, I was (and still am!) a classical flutist. During my musical career, I particularly enjoyed performing as an orchestral musician, and I was especially fond of performing opera.
