## Latest news

- I will be attending the 34th Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society (SEALS 34) in Bali, Indonesia from June 11-13, 2025, where I will be presenting the talk 'Strategies of focus marking in Yami (Tao)'. Hope to see you there!

## Hello!

I am a linguist, and my research has largely centered around the language spoken by the Indigenous Tao/Yami islanders of Orchid Island, southeastern Taiwan. I am a PhD Candidate at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I am a member of the [SPArK Phonetics Lab](https://www.ucsb-spark.com/) led by Dr. Argyro Katsika and the Language Documentation Lab led by Dr. Marianne Mithun, and I am an assistant director of the OLA (Ortografías en Lenguas Aborígenes) Lab led by Dr. Eric W. Campbell. I also regularly teach linguistics courses at the undergraduate level.

My research spans several different areas of linguistic inquiry. Here are a few topics I have worked on to greater detail:
- Acoustics and grammatical functions of word stress and prosodic prominence
- Case marking systems, specifically non-core case categories
- Clause chaining and other complex clause linkage strategies
- The expression of information structure (topic and focus)

Prior to my journey into academic & linguistic research, I was (and still am!) a classical flutist. During my musical career, I particularly enjoyed performing as an orchestral musician, and I was especially fond of performing opera.
