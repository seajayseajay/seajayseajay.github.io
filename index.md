## Latest news

- My paper "A first look at the prosody of focus and stress in Yami (Tao)" with Argyro Katsika has been accepted to the *Speech Prosody 2026* conference (May 26-29, 2026)! Hope to see you in Philadelphia!
- I'm officially on the job market! I am open to academic positions (tenure-track, lecturer, postdoc) in Linguistics, Anthropology, or related fields (e.g. English, Modern Languages, East Asian Studies, etc.).

## Hello!

I am a linguist and linguistic anthropologist. My research has largely centered around the language spoken by the Indigenous Tao/Yami islanders of Orchid Island, southeastern Taiwan, and I have steadily growing interests in the Otomanguean languages of Oaxaca, Mexico, especially spoken by the Mixtec & Zapotec diaspora in the United States. I am a PhD Candidate at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I am a member of the [SPArK Phonetics Lab](https://www.ucsb-spark.com/) led by Dr. Argyro Katsika and the Language Documentation Lab led by Dr. Marianne Mithun, and I am an assistant director of the OLA (Ortografías en Lenguas Aborígenes) Lab led by Dr. Eric W. Campbell. I also regularly teach linguistics courses at the undergraduate level.

My research spans several different areas of linguistic inquiry. Here are a few topics I have worked on to greater detail:
- Acoustics and grammatical functions of word stress and prosodic prominence
- The expression of information structure (topic and focus)
- Case marking systems, specifically non-core case categories
- Clause chaining and other complex clause linkage strategies

Prior to my journey into academic & linguistic research, I was (and still am!) a classical flutist. During my musical career, I particularly enjoyed performing as an orchestral musician, and I was especially fond of performing opera.
